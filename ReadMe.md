# Project "Winforms"

Introducing my first CLI/Console to a "true" Windows program port in a .NET 8/9 environment.
It is a bit rough around the edges for the time being (notably the comments), but we'll get there. ☕

Of course this application won't work unless you have access to a copy of the DB used. Enclosed you will find TestDB.sql which can be used in SSMS to re-create the DB.

This will be a part of my "CLI/Console to Winforms port" series in order to (hopefully) show my continued understanding of Winforms.
